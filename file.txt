Brain tumor
abstract
There has been a significant increase in the number of medical cases
involving brain tumors in the last few years, ranking it the 1 0th most
common form of tumor affecting children and adults. Detection and
segmentation of brain tumor is most crucial and time taking task in the
field of medical image processing because of high variation of the size,
shape, location of brain tumor. Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) is
broadly used for detecting tumor and diagnosis various tissues
abnormalities. Accurate investigation of the size and location of brain
tumor plays an important role in the diagnosis of brain tumor. In this
paper, we present a deep learning-based method to segment and
classify brain tumor in MRI. First, we preprocessed images using image
augmentation and Gaussian blur filter. Then segmentation is done using
binary thresholding. For features extraction, we use morphological
operations. At the end, using CNN classify the brain MRI as normal or
abnormal. We use Kaggle Dataset in this work. We use 255 brain MRI
from it 1 55 contains tumor and 98 images of healthy brain to train the
model and get 97% accuracy. To test the model, we use different Kaggle
datasets of brain MRI

1 .1 Brain tumor:
The brain tumor is one all the foremost common and, therefore, the deadliest brain
diseases that have affected and ruined several lives in the world. Cancer is a disease in
the brain in which
Cancer cells ascends in brain tissues.
Conferring to a new study on cancer, more than one lakh people are diagnosed with brain
tumors every year around the globe. Regardless of stable efforts to overcome the
complications of brain tumors, figures show unpleasing results for tumor patients.
To contest this, scholars are working on computer vision for a better understanding of the
early stages of tumors and how to overcome using advanced treatment options. Magnetic
resonance
(MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain are the two most
general tests
to check the existence of a tumor and recognize its position for progressive treatment
decisions.
These two scans are still used extensively for their handiness, and the capability to yield
high-definition images of pathological tissues is more. At present, there are several other
conducts offered for tumors, which include surgery, therapies such as radiation therapy,
and chemotherapy. The decision for which treatment relies on the many factors such as
size, kind, and grade of the tumor present in the MR image.
It’s conjointly chargeable for whether or not cancer has reached the other portions of the
body. Precise sighting of the kind of brain abnormality is enormously needed for
treatment operations with a resolution to diminish diagnostic errors.
The precision is often makeshift utilizing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems.
The essential plan of computer vision is to produce a reliable output, which is an
associate estimation to assist medical doctors in image understanding and to lessen
image reading time. These advancements increase the steadiness and correctness of
medical diagnosis — however, segmenting an MR image of the tumor and its area itself a
very problematic job.
The occurrence of tumors in specific positions within the brain image without
distinguishing picture intensities is an additional issue that makes a computerized
detection of brain tumor and segmentation a problematic job.

Brain tumor
In past few decades, brain tumor segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
has become an emergent research area in the field of medical imaging systems.
Accurate detection of brain tumor plays a vital role in the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Our project aims to develop a program which analyses the Magnetic Resonance Images
